title: Direct Data-Driven Control with Embedded Anti-Windup Compensation
abstract: Input saturation is an ubiquitous nonlinearity in control systems and arises
  from the fact that all actuators are subject to a maximum power, thereby resulting
  in a hard limitation on the allowable magnitude of the input effort. In the scientific
  literature, anti-windup augmentation has been proposed to recover the desired linear
  closed-loop dynamics during transients, but the effectiveness of such a compensation
  is strongly linked to the accuracy of the mathematical model of the plant. In this
  work, it is shown that a feedback controller with embedded anti-windup compensator
  can be directly identified from data, by suitably extending the existing data-driven
  design theory. The effectiveness of the resulting method is illustrated on a benchmark
  simulation example.
