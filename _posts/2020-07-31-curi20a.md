title: Structured Variational Inference in Partially Observable UnstableGaussian Process
  State Space Models
abstract: We propose a new variational inference algorithm for learning in Gaussian
  Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs). Our algorithm enables learning of unstable
  and partially observable systems, where previous algorithms fail. Our main algorithmic
  contribution is a novel approximate posterior that can be calculated efficiently
  using a single forward and backward pass along the training trajectories. The forward-backward
  pass is inspired on Kalman smoothing for linear dynamical systems but generalizes
  to GPSSMs. Our second contribution is a modification of the conditioning step that
  effectively lowers the Kalman gain. This modification is crucial to attaining good
  test performance where no measurements are available. Finally, we show experimentally
  that our learning algorithm performs well in stable and unstable real systems with
  hidden states.
