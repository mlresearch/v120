title: A Theoretical Analysis of Deep Q-Learning
abstract: Despite the great empirical success of deep reinforcement learning, its
  theoretical foundation is less well understood. In this work, we make the first
  attempt to theoretically understand the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm (Mnih et
  al., 2015) from both algorithmic and statistical perspectives. In specific, we focus
  on the fitted Q iteration (FQI) algorithm with deep neural networks, which is a
  slight simplification of DQN that captures the tricks of experience replay and target
  network used in DQN. Under mild assumptions, we establish the algorithmic and statistical
  rates of convergence for the action-value functions of the iterative policy sequence
  obtained by FQI. In particular, the statistical error characterizes the bias and
  variance that arise from approximating the action-value function using deep neural
  network, while the algorithmic error converges to zero at a geometric rate. As a
  byproduct, our analysis provides justifications for the techniques of experience
  replay and target network, which are crucial to the empirical success of DQN. Furthermore,
  as a simple extension of DQN, we propose the Minimax-DQN algorithm for zero-sum
  Markov game with two players, which is deferred to the appendix due to space limitations.
