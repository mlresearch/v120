title: Counterfactual Programming for Optimal Control
abstract: 'In recent years, considerable work has been done to tackle the issue of
  designing control laws based on observations to allow unknown dynamical systems
  to perform pre-specified tasks. At least as important for autonomy, however, is
  the issue of learning which tasks can be performed in the first place. This is particularly
  critical in situations where multiple (possibly conflicting) tasks and requirements
  are demanded from the agent, resulting in infeasible specifications. Such situations
  arise due to over-specification or dynamic operating conditions and are only aggravated
  when the dynamical system model is learned through simulations. Often, these issues
  are tackled using regularization and penalties tuned based on application-specific
  expert knowledge. Nevertheless, this solution becomes impractical for large-scale
  systems, unknown operating conditions, and/or in online settings where expert input
  would be needed during the system operation. Instead, this work enables agents to
  autonomously pose, tune, and solve optimal control problems by compromising between
  performance and specification costs. Leveraging duality theory, it puts forward
  a counterfactual optimization algorithm that directly determines the specification
  trade-off while solving the optimal control problem. '
