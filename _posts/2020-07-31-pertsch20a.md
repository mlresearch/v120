title: 'Keyframing the Future: Keyframe Discovery for Visual Prediction and Planning'
abstract: To flexibly and efficiently reason about dynamics of temporal sequences,
  abstract representations that compactly represent the important information in the
  sequence are needed. One way of constructing such representations is by focusing
  on the important events in a sequence. In this paper, we propose a model that learns
  both to discover such key events (or keyframes) as well as to represent the sequence
  in terms of them.  We do so using a hierarchical Keyframe-Inpainter (KeyIn) model
  that first generates keyframes and their temporal placement and then inpaints the
  sequences between keyframes. We propose a fully differentiable formulation for efficiently
  learning the keyframe placement. We show that KeyIn finds informative keyframes
  in several datasets with diverse dynamics. When evaluated on a planning task, KeyIn
  outperforms other recent proposals for learning hierarchical representations.
