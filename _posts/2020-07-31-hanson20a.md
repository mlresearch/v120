title: Universal Simulation of Dynamical Systems by Recurrent Neural Nets
abstract: 'It is well-known that continuous-time recurrent neural nets are universal
  approximators for continuous-time dynamical systems. However, existing results provide
  approximation guarantees only for finite-time trajectories. In this work, we show
  that infinite-time trajectories generated by dynamical systems that are stable in
  a certain sense can be reproduced arbitrarily accurately by recurrent neural nets.
  For a subclass of these stable systems, we provide quantitative estimates on the
  sufficient number of neurons needed to achieve a specified error tolerance. '
